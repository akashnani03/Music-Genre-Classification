# Music Genre Classification
 Music Genre Classification Using Deep Learning
Using a limited amount of music files, Music Genre Classification model automatically classifies music into distinct genres based on a variety of musical characteristics and qualities. This subject is very important for the field of music information retrieval since it offers a method for arranging and analyzing a lot of music files. Conventional machine learning methods like SVM, KNN, Decision trees, and neural networks can be used for MGC. In order to divide the audio files into several genres, these algorithms are trained to identify various musical characteristics and traits. Research indicates that deep learning algorithms like CNN, ANN, and others outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in a variety of applications. As a result, the CNN algorithm is modified to carry out the music file classification. This uses CNN deep learning algorithms to classify musical genres. Accuracy is used to assess how well the MGC algorithms work. Furthermore, the effects of various algorithms on MGC performance can be examined and contrasted. It can be used in music production, music education, and automated music recommendation systems. With CNN, the MGC task is completed with an accuracy of 83%.

#About The Dataset

The GTZAN genre collection dataset was collected in 2000-2001. It consists of 1000 audio files each having 30 seconds duration and a CSV file. There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format. It contains audio files of the following 10 genres:
Blues
Classical
Country
